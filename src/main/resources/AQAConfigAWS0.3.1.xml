    <!-- List of DICOM attributes to be anonymized to protect institutional identities.  The Name and

         Name: The name by which the attribute is referenced.

         Tag:  The hex numeric tag of the attribute.

     At least one of Name or Tag must be specified.

     If both Name and Tag are given, then the Name will be associated with the Tag.

     If just Name is given, Pixelmed's standard dictionary will be used to look up the tag.

     If just the Tag is given and the tag is in Pixelmed's standard dictionary, then the Pixelmed name
     will be used.

     If just the Tag is given and the tag is not in Pixelmed's standard dictionary, then tag will also
     be used as the Name.

     The 'Value' XML attribute is used when a constant value is to be used for anonymizing the original
     value.  This is used when it is not important to be able to recover the original contents, and the
     field has specific formatting requirements (such as time or date).

     If the 'Value' XML attribute is not given, then the DICOM attribute will be anonymized to either:
         - for UIDs: To a new unique UID
         - for non-UIDs: To the 'Name' XML attribute followed by an underscore and a unique integer.  For
           example, StationName might be anonymized to StationName_43

     Warning: If a Name value is not in the standard dictionary, then the server will halt with
     a java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError error.
