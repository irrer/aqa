Creating a Custom Plan

To run the Phase 2 tests, you must submit a set of EPID images created by a compatible RTPLAN.

Often simply copying an RTPLAN from another institution does not work because of incompatibilities with
machine name, beam energies, and tolerance table names.  The Customize Plan feature addresses this.

The steps are:

Navigate to Administration --> Machines

Select the machine from the list that you wish to make the plan for.  If it does not exist, use Create new Machine to create it.

Make sure that the list of beam energies that your machine supports is correct.

Click the Customize Plan button

The following screen shot shows an example for a machine named Foo.




Fill in the fields:

    Patient ID: This will be filled with a default value but you may override it with something that will make it easy for you to track in your system.
    
    Patient Name: Similar to Patient ID
    
    Tolerance Table Name: Initially empty, this must be filled with a tolerance table that your system supports.
    
    Machine Name: The name that your planning system expects.  Some planning systems have different values for machine ID and machine name.
    
Click the Create button and the following will be shown:




Click Download to download a DICOM version of the RTPLAN.

The RTPLAN may be imported into your planning system.


Note: The AQA keeps track of custom made plans, so it is not necessary to upload them later.
