    <h3>Notes on CSV Files</h3>
    <p>
        CSV files are intended as a way to provide access to the aggregated data for study and research.
        The data spans all institutions and is <a href="/static/doc/Anonymization/index.html">anonymized</a>.
        Users can <a href="/AnonymousTranslate?html=1">view the original values</a> for their own institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        These files are generated manually by the system administrator. It is expected that they will be re-generated
        on a regular basis so as to include the latest data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data within each CSV is grouped by machine, with a separating blank row between machines. Within each machine,
        data is sorted by date. Maintenance records are embedded chronologically in the data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CSV files were designed with a bias towards being complete rather than minimal. It is expected that the
        user may discard or hide a majority of the columns to focus on what is pertinent. DICOM values have been
        provided to provide greater insight and possibly explain outliers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except for Maintenance Records, the CSV columns are organized in four main sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Institution, machine, and time stamps.</li>
        <li>Data unique to the given type of analysis.</li>
        <li>Machine characteristics, URL referencing report, and user that uploaded the data.</li>
        <li>DICOM values associated with the data. This can be useful to find correlations between data
            characteristics and machine settings. Some data sets (Collimator Centering, VMAT, and Wedge) have two sets
            of DICOM files, in which case the columns names will be slightly different for each. The types of DICOM
            metadata are the same for all CSV files. The column descriptions for DICOM fields are appended with
            <i>DICOM GGGG,EEEE</i> to indicate the standard group and element as hex characters. Since the same DICOM
            files can be used for multiple tests, the same values may appear in different CSV files.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Also note that CSV files are one way to access data, but it is also possible to access the database directly.
        This allows the use of tools such as <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> or
        <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerBI</a> to make your own custom reports. For arranging direct
        access to the database, contact the site administrator.
