    <h3>Notes on CSV Files</h3>
    <p>
        CSV files are intended as a way to provide access to the aggregated data for study and research.
        The data spans all institutions and is anonymized.
    </p>
    <p>Data within each CSV is grouped by machine, with a separating blank row between machines. Within each machine,
        data is sorted by date. Maintenance records are embedded chronologically in the data.</p>
    <p>
        Except for Maintenance Records, the CSV columns are organized in four main sections:
    <ul>
        <li>Institution, machine, and time stamps.</li>
        <li>Data unique to the given type of analysis.</li>
        <li>Machine characteristics, URL referencing report, and user that uploaded the data.</li>
        <li>DICOM values associated with the data. This can be useful to find correlations between data
            characteristics and machine settings. Some data sets (Collimator Centering, VMAT, and Wedge) have two sets
            of DICOM files. The columns names will be slightly different for each DICOM file. The types of DICOM
            metadata are the same for all CSV files. The column descriptions for DICOM fields are appended with
            <i>DICOM GGGG,EEEE</i> to indicate the standard group and element as hex characters.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Also note that CSV files are one way to access data, but it is also possible to access the database directly.
        This allows the use of tools such as <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> or
        <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerBI</a> to make your own custom reports. For direct
        access to the database, contact the site administrator.
