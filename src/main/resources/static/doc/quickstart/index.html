    To run a test on the AQA platform a machine and RTPLAN must first be created ( account required, contact
    <a href="mailto:irrer@med.umich.edu">Jim Irrer</a>
    or
    <a href="mailto:nbaughan@med.umich.edu">Natalie Baughan</a>
    )
    . This is only done once, and
    subsequently tests may be run against the machine many times by repeating steps 3 and
    4.

    <p>a. Each institution will receive user accounts that will have access to run files and create additional accounts.
        This account
        must be created by, please contact them to get set
        up. They will send you your account details.

        <p>
            Fill fields to reflect your machine, and click

        </h4>
        <p>Click the name of the newly created machine, then the "Customize Plan" button at the bottom.</p>

        <p>
            The
            <b>Patient ID</b>
            ,
            <b>Patient Name</b>
            , and
            <b>Plan Name</b>
            are arbitrary, but can be helpful for tracking the machine's test activity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The
            <b>Tolerance Table Name</b>
            should be one that exists in your treatment planning system. The
            <b>Machine Name</b>
            is given
            a default, but may need to be changed to match the name expected by the treatment machine.
        </p>

        <p>
            Click
            <b>Create</b>
            to create the RTPLAN. This will bring up another page with a link to download the just-created RTPLAN.
        </p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">3: Run the RTPLAN</h4>

        <p>Import the RTPLAN into your treatment system.</p>

        <p>Verify the couch coordinates are correct for your machine.
            The couch needs to be retracted so it won't be on
            imager,
            but still in a position to beam on.
        </p>

        <p>Schedule sessions and add integrated image template in scheduling.
            The plan needs to run as integrated, not
            continuous.
        </p>

        <p>Imager should be at 1500 mm (not at ISO)</p>

        <p>Schedule at machine, deliver in QA mode, and export the RTIMAGE files.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">4: Run the Test</h4>

        <p>
            On the AQA site, click

        <p>Drag and drop the RTIMAGE files into the upload box.</p>

        <p>
            Click the
            <b>Run</b>
            button to start the analysis, which takes less than 2 minutes.
