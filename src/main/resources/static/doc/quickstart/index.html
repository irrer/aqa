    To run a test on the AQA platform a machine and RTPLAN must first be created ( account required, contact
    <a href="mailto:irrer@med.umich.edu?subject=AQA Account request">Jim Irrer</a>
    or
    <a href="mailto:nbaughan@med.umich.edu?subject=AQA Account request">Natalie Baughan</a>
    )
    . This is only done once, and
    subsequently tests may be run against the machine many times by repeating steps 3 and
    4.

    <p>a. Each institution will receive user accounts that will have access to run files and create additional accounts.
        This account
        must be created by, please contact them to get set

        The
        <b>Patient ID</b>
        ,
        <b>Patient Name</b>
        , and
        <b>Plan Name</b>
        are arbitrary, but can be helpful for tracking the machine's test activity.

    <p>
        The
        <b>Tolerance Table Name</b>
        should be one that exists in your treatment planning system. The
        <b>Machine Name</b>
        is given
        a default, but may need to be changed to match the name expected by the treatment machine.

        Click
        <b>Create</b>
        to create the RTPLAN. This will bring up another page with a link to download the just-created RTPLAN.

    <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">3: Treat With the RTPLAN</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Import the RTPLAN into your treatment system.
            <p />
        </li>

        <li>
            Verify the couch coordinates are correct for your machine.
            The couch needs to be retracted so it won't be on
            imager,
            but still in a position to beam on.
            <p />
        </li>

        <li>
            Schedule sessions and add integrated image template in scheduling.
            The plan needs to run as integrated, not
            continuous.
            <p />
        </li>

        <li>
            Imager should be at 1500 mm (not at ISO)
            <p />
        </li>

        <li>
            Schedule at machine, deliver in QA mode, and export the RTIMAGE files.
            <p />
        </li>

        <li>
            Manually enter the imager coordinates: 50cm, 0, 0
            <p />
        </li>
    </ul>
