    <p>
        To analyze data on the AQA platform, a user must define a machine and create the RTPLAN
        file ( account required, contact
        <a href="mailto:irrer@med.umich.edu?subject=AQA Account request">Jim Irrer</a>
        ). This step is only done once, and subsequent
        tests may be run against the defined machine repeatedly. The steps involved are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Deliver the planned fields on the machine defined in the AQA platform</li>
        <li>Export the images</li>
        <li>Upload the images and plan to the AQA website on AWS</li>
        <li>Run the tests on the images on AWS. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each institution will receive user accounts that will have access to run files and create
        additional accounts. This account must be created by Jim Irrer, please contact Jim at
        irrer@med.umich.edu
        to request up to 2 active accounts for your institution. Jim will send you your account details.

        Fill out the requested information to reflect your machine, and click
        <b>Create</b>
        . This leads to the
        creation of your machine and the screen will return to the list of machines. Each Linear accelerator
        is referred to as a Machine in the software.

        <a href="/static/doc/CustomizePlan/index.html" title="Click for more detailed guide">Create RTPLAN</a>
    </h4>
    <p>Click the name of the newly created machine, then the "Customize Plan" button at the bottom.</p>

    <p>
        The
        <b>Patient ID</b>
        ,
        <b>Patient Name</b>
        , and
        <b>Plan Name</b>
        are arbitrary, but can be helpful for tracking the machine's test activity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The
        <b>Tolerance Table Name</b>
        should be one that exists in your treatment planning system.
    </p>

    <p>
        The
        <b>Machine Name</b>
        should be one that exists in your treatment planning and management systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Click
        <b>Create</b>
        to create the RTPLAN. This will bring up another page with a link to download the just-created RTPLAN.
    </p>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">3: Import RTPLAN into your Treatment Management System and make minor modifications to plan</h4>

    <ul>

        <li>Import the RTPLAN into your treatment system.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Note any errors/warnings you receive during import</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Verify the couch coordinates are correct for your machine. The couch needs to be retracted so
            it won't be on imager, but still in a position to beam on. (At UM, we use couch long of
            +20 cm)
        </li>
        <li>Schedule sessions and add integrated image template in scheduling.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The plan needs to acquire
                <b>integrated images</b>
                , not continuous.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>At UM, we perform the couch position and imager position in Treatment Preparation</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Source to Imager distance should be 150 cm for each field (not at ISOCENTER)</li>
        in Aria.
        <li>
            The imported plan will have a 3
            <sup>rd</sup>
            party approval, thus plan approval will need to
            be performed at your institution.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">4a: Acquire dark field for each energy and run Isocal verification. [DF update should be performed prior to AQA delivery]</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Enter service mode with sufficient rights to update dark field and run Isocal verification.</li>
        <li>PVA calibrations.</li>
        <li>Select Imaging Technique you are using, typically Dosimetry. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>It is beneficial to use a dosimetry mode because the QA for this mode may differ from that used for modes that are solely used for patient imaging.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Perform calibration for the dark field for each energy.</li>
        <li>Export the MV dosimetry correction files from the XI node. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>[This will be useful in correcting subsequent images back to a known point in time if any of the correction files have changed]</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Perform IsoCal Verification</li>
        <li>Export the results for tracking, since phantomless AQA will rely on the corrections. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">4: Deliver planned fields at the linac in QA mode</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Schedule at machine, open the plan in QA mode</li>
        <li>Double check the source to image distance is correct. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Typical image coordinates at UM are (+50 cm vertical, 0 lat, 0 long)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Deliver the plan in QA mode (should take &lt; 20 minutes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="margin-top: 35px;">
        5: Export &amp; Upload Images, and Run the Test on
        <a href="https://automatedqualityassurance.org">https://automatedqualityassurance.org</a>
    </h4>
    <ul>

        <li>Export the RTIMAGE files to a known location.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>For example, go to Image Browser in Aria, select the last N images acquired, and export using the DICOM media file filter.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            On the AQA site, click
            <b>Run Procedure</b>
            &#8594;
            <b>Phase2</b>
        </li>
        <li>Drag and drop the RTIMAGE files into the upload box.</li>
        <li>
            Click the
            <b>Run</b>
            button to start the analysis, which takes less than 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Results will be displayed automatically, showing an overview of results. Click on the tests for more details.</li>
    </ul>
