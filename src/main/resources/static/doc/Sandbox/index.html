    <p>
        The AQA sandbox is a separate installation of the software and data that allows users to introduce known errors
        and verify that AQA responds as expected. In other words, 'test the test'.
    </p>


    The production and sandbox systems are at the following URSs and have different logos to avoid confusion:
    <div class="row">
        <p style="margin:40px;"></p>
        <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center;">
            <a href="https://automatedqualityassurance.org" target="_blank"> https://automatedqualityassurance.org </a>
            <br/>
            <a href="https://automatedqualityassurance.org" target="_blank">
                <img src="production.png" style="margin:30px;" width="200px;" alt="Production logo"/>
            </a>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; text-align:center;">
            <a href="https://test.automatedqualityassurance.org" target="_blank">
                https://test.automatedqualityassurance.org </a>
            <br/>
            <a href="https://test.automatedqualityassurance.org" target="_blank">
                <img src="test.png" style="margin:30px;" width="200px;" alt="Sandbox logo"/>
            </a>
        </div>

    </div>

    <p>
        The sandbox contains a copy of all the meta-data such as machine configurations and user accounts that were on
        the production system (as of February 2024). This saves the effort of re-configuration. Note that because this
        is a copy, changes made on one system will not automatically be made on the other.
    </p>


    <p>
        The chief difference of the sandbox software is that it allows users to break the rules. In production, when
        performing a test, the RTPLAN referenced by the RTIMAGE files is used. The sandbox allows uses to specify a
        different RTPLAN.
    </p>


    <h3>Running a Test</h3>
    <p>
        To run a test with known errors:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Use a treatment planning system to modify an existing AQA RTPLAN (custom plan can be made by either
            system). Introduce the desired known errors by changing jaw positions, collimator angles, etc.
        </li>
        <li> Deliver the modified plan. This creates images with known errors.</li>
        <li> Upload the images to the sandbox via 'Run Procedure' with the original 'good' RTPLAN. This tells the
            software to use this plan instead of the modified one that the images reference. Note: This will not work on
            the production system.
        </li>
        <li> View the results.</li>
    </ul>
