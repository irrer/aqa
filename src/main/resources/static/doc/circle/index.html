Circles

Circles are used to sample circular regions of the EPID as
an measurement of dose.  They are used by the center dose,
wedge and symmetry/flatness/constancy tests.

The dose from a circle is calculated by calculating the
average CU (calibrated units) of all pixels that lie within
a 10 mm diameter circle as measured in the isoplane.

To determine the center of the circle in the isoplane, the
expected center (determined by the test) is added to the
collimator's center of rotation, as determined in the
Collimator Centering test.

To determine the pixels that should be averaged, the
positions of pixels in the image plane are projected back to
the isoplane (LINK: using SID and SAD).  All pixels whose
centers fall within the radius of the circle are used.

Because a circle is being projected onto a rectangular
pixel array, pixels on the edge of the circle will only have
part of their area within the circle.  If the center of the
pixel is inside the circle or not, then the entire pixel is
used or not; no attempt is made to partially weight the
pixel's influence.

Also note that although the collimator's center of rotation
is generally a small number, even smaller than the width of
the pixels, it may cause some pixels to be include or not
included that otherwise would be.
