    <p>
        Circles are used to sample circular regions of the EPID as
        an measurement of dose. They are used by the center dose,
        wedge and symmetry/flatness/constancy tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dose from a circle is calculated by calculating the
        average CU (calibrated units) of all pixels that lie within
        the circle as measured in the isoplane.
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine the center of the circle in the isoplane, the
        expected center (determined by the test) is added to the
        collimator's center of rotation, as determined in the
        Collimator Centering test.
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine the pixels that should be averaged, the
        positions of pixels in the image plane are projected back to
        the isoplane (LINK: using SID and SAD). All pixels whose
        centers fall within the radius of the circle are used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because a circle is being projected onto a rectangular
        pixel array, pixels on the edge of the circle will only have
        part of their area within the circle. If the center of the
        pixel is inside the circle or not, then the entire pixel is
        used or not; no attempt is made to partially weight the
        pixel's influence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also note that although the collimator's center of rotation
        is generally a small number, even smaller than the width of
        the pixels, it may cause some pixels to be include or not
        included that otherwise would be.
