    <p>Edges measurement is used by multiple tests, including Collimator Centering and Collimator Position
    </p>

    <p>Generally, sets of four edges of a rectangle are found, as shown in example below:
    </p>

    <div style="margin:30px;">

            <br />
            <i>Example of finding four edges. Dashed lines show edge location. Click for full sized image.
            </i>
        </center>
    </div>

    <p>The first step is to use the associated RTPLAN to determine the expected position and length of the edge.
        As an example, consider the left in the image above. The horizontal position is given by
        the RTPLAN, and the expected vertical length is given by top and bottom edges.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given the expected position, a bounding box is created, using the penumbra width. The penumbra width is
        defined as the configuration value
        <b>PenumbraThickness_mm</b>
        . For the left edge, the bounding box
        is centered horizontally around the the expected position, and the width is the penumbra width.
    </p>

    <p>To improve the accuracy of the measurement of the left edge, interference from the intersecting top and
        bottom edges must be removed. This is done by limiting the top and bottom of the bounding
        box by 1/2 the
        penumbra width from the top and bottom edges.
    </p>

    <p>The bounding box is indicated by the black lines, and annotated in the detail below with the white lines
        and arrows.
    </p>

    <div style="margin:30px;">
        <center>
            <a href='leftEdgeDetail.png' title='Detail of bounding box.  Click for image.'>
                <img src='leftEdgeDetail.png' />
            </a>
            <br />
            <i>Left edge detail.
            </i>
        </center>
    </div>

    <p>A profile of the edge is then created by summing each column of pixel. In the case of a horizontal edge,
        the rows would be summed. The resulting profile is then smoothed using a cubic spline as
        shown below:
    </p>

    <div style="margin:30px;">
        <p style="margin:10px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
            <a href='rawToCubic.png' title='Raw profile and corresponding cubic spline.  Click for image.'>
                <img src='rawToCubic.png' />
            </a>
            <center>
                <i>Note: The above image is an approximation of real data. The ends have been trimmed and coarseness
                    has been exaggerated in the above image for illustration purposes.
                </i>
            </center>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Using the cubic spline, a binary search which tries different horizontal inputs is used to find the vertical position where the curve is halfway (
        <b>50%</b>
        ) between
        the upper and lower bounds. The resulting horizontal position is used as the edge measurement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notes:

        <ul>
            <li>The bounding box approach is designed to use the maximum possible number of pixels. This reduces the influence of any aberrant pixels.</li>

            <li>The cubic spline is implemented in double precision floating point and yields sub-pixel accuracy.</li>

            <li>It is expected that the penumbra value is chosen to be large enough such that the upper and lower bounds plateau.</li>

            <li>
                While there are edge detection algorithms such as
                <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector'>Canny</a>
                , the purpose
                here is not to detect whether there is an edge, but to measure as precisely as feasible where the edge is.
            </li>

            <li>In the event that a single well defined edge is not in the bounding box predicted by the RTPLAN, the algorithm can produce unpredictable results. Examples would be an area where there
                were multiple edges or an area that was featureless.
            </li>

        </ul>
