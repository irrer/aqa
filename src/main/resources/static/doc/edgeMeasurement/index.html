    <p>Edges measurement is used by Collimator Centering and Collimator Position 
    </p>



The AQA algorithm is to use the expected position of an edge
to form a bounding rectangle around it.  For a vertical
edge, the columns in the region are summed, providing a
profile that uses as many pixels as possible.  A cubic
spline is drawn through the profile, and then a point is
chosen on that spline to determine the edge's location.  The
percent is a configurable parameter which is set to %80.

Note that for the example shown, the upper and lower ends of
the edge are not considered, because there is interference
with the horizontal edge.


TODO : how do I determine the ceiling and floor?


A number of edge detection algorithms (such as TODO) are
designed to find an edge in a visually noisey scene, but
they do not yield answers to a high degree of sub-pixel
accuracy.  For treatment machine quality assurance, the
approximate location of the edge is known, as well as it's
shape, so this can be leveraged to use methods that are
highly accurate but do not do well with noisy images.  If
the edge is not approximately where it is expected to be,
then the test will be failing anyway so the point is moot.
