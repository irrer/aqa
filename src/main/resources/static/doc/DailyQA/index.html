    <p>
        To perform the complete Daily QA procedure, a CBCT of the phantom with bb is
        captured, the table is moved, and then two EPID (MV) images are captured at orthogonal angles.

    <h3>Processing</h3>
    <div>
        The
        <a href="../DailyQACBCT/index.html">Daily QA CBCT</a>
        procedure yields the $X,Y,Z$ for $CBCT - RTPLAN$. After the table
        is moved, two EPID images are captured at orthogonal angles. The EPID images produce two sets of
        <a href="../IsoplaneProjection/index.html">values in XY coordinates</a>
        , which are converted to RTPLAN (a.k.a. world) coordinates using the following:

        <ul>
            <li>

                $X_{vertT}, Y_{vertT}, X_{horzT}, Y_{horzT}, $
                :
                Position in (x,y,z) coordinates of origin of IEC X-RAY IMAGE RECEPTOR System in the IEC GANTRY
                coordinate system mm (from RTIMAGE). The X
                and Y are used from both the vertical and horizontal
                EPID images.
                <p>
                </p>

                :
                Treatment machine gantry angle, i.e., orientation of IEC GANTRY coordinate system with respect to IEC FIXED REFERENCE coordinate
                system in degrees (from RTIMAGE).
                Angles from the vertical and horizontal EPID images are used.
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                $X_{vert}$:
                The bb X position in from the EPID image with a vertical gantry angle in image plane coordinates.
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                $X_{horz}$:
                The bb X position in from the EPID image with a horizontal gantry angle in image plane coordinates.
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                $Y_{vert},Y_{horz}$:
                The bb Y positions in from each of the two EPID images in image plane coordinates.
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                $X_{CBCT},Y_{CBCT},Z_{CBCT}$:
                The bb position in from the CBCT analysis in RTPLAN coordinates.
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <it>Image plane coordinates are the same as gantry plane coordinates except that the Y axis is in the opposite direction.</it>

        <p>
            This produces the EPID position by converting from gantry coordinates to RTPLAN coordinates.
        </p>

        $$ MV G horizontal (BB - DIGITAL_CAX) @ ISOCENTER PLANE = Y_{epid} = sin(G_{horz}) \times (X_{horz} - X_{vertT}) $$
        $$ MV G vertical (BB - DIGITAL_CAX) @ ISOCENTER PLANE = X_{epid} =
        cos(G_{vert}) \times (X_{vert} - X_{horzT}) $$
        $$ Z_{epid} = { { (-Y_{vert}) - Y_{vertT} - (-Y_{horz}) - Y_{horzT} }
        \over 2 } $$
        <p>
            The $Z_{epid}$ is the average of the vertical and horizontal angles. If more than two EPID images are available, then
            $Z_{epid}$ is the average of the values such that there are the same
            number of vertical and horizontal images. For example,
            if there were two horizontal images and three vertical images, then it would be the average of the two horizontal images and
            two
            randomly chosen of the three vertical images.
