        This describes the BB finding algorithm and precise measurement of the BB's location.
    </p>

    <h3>Coarse (approximate) Location of BB</h3>
    <p>
        The first step is to determine the BB's approximate location within the EPID plane. This is done by restricting
        the search area to a square centered in the image. The size of the square is 2 x BBbyEPIDSearchDistance_mm,
        where BBbyEPIDSearchDistance_mm is a configuration value. The size of the square is smaller than the cube
        containing the BB, as shown by the yellow box below.
    </p>

        <img width='512' src="FullImage.png" style="margin:5px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;"/>
    </center>
    <p>
        The square is searched by examining each possible array of 2x2 pixels to see which is the
        brightest. Next, the brightest adjacent pixels are included until an area has been acquired that is equivalent
        to the area of the BB.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image below shows a close up image with pixel values contrasted for clarity. The pixels of the BB are
        identified and marked as green.
    </p>

        <img width='512' src="Closeup.png" style="margin:5px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;"/>
    </center>

    <p>
        The center of mass (which includes the pixels' location and brightness) of the BB's
        pixels is calculated in X and Y to determine the BB's precise location.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the BB's location to be valid, it must be significantly brighter than the surrounding pixels. For
        validation, the standard deviation and mean of the pixels in the search area that are not included by the BB is
        calculated. A BB standard deviation multiple is calculated by:

    <div style="text-indent: 50px;">
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $SearchArea_{mean}$ : Mean value of pixels inside the search area but not part of the BB
        </p>
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $BB_{mean}$ : Mean value of BB's pixels (shown in green)
        </p>
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $SearchArea_{StandardDeviation}$ : Standard deviation of pixels in search area but not part of BB
        </p>
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $$absoluteValueOf(BB_{mean} - SearchArea_{mean}) / SearchArea_{StandardDeviation} $$
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        If this value is large enough, then the BB is considered valid. The configuration value
        <b><i>EPIDBBMinimumStandardDeviation</i></b> is used for the comparison.
    </p>
