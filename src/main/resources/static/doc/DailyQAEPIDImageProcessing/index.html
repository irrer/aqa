    <p>
        This describes the BB finding algorithm and precise measurement of the BB's location.
    </p>

    <hr style='margin:40px;'/>
    <h3>Defining the Search Area (Area of Interest)</h3>
    <p>
        The first step is to determine the BB's approximate location within the EPID plane. This is done by restricting
        the search area to a square centered in the image. The size of the square is 2 x BBbyEPIDSearchDistance_mm,
        where BBbyEPIDSearchDistance_mm is a configuration value (currently set to 8 mm, so the search area is 16x16mm).
        The size of the square is smaller than the cube containing the BB, as shown by the yellow box below.
    </p>
    <center style="margin:40px;">
        <img width='512' src="FullImage.png" style="margin:5px; border: 1px solid lightgray;"/>
    </center>
    <p>
        The reason for restricting the initial search area is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Frequently there are element of the table in the image, and this is a simple way to ignore them.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the BB is outside of this area, then the test would be considered a failure anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
            Processing a smaller area is more resource efficient.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr style='margin:40px;'/>
    <h3>Columnar Amplification Correction</h3>

    <p>
        The next step is to correct the image for differences in pixel amplification. When EPID images are captured,
        each column is processed by a different amplifier circuit. Small differences between amplifiers can make some
        columns brighter or darker than others.
    </p>

    <p>
        To correct for differences in columnar amplification, the areas above and below the search area are taken as
        shown below. Each are the same size as the search area. Due to the design of the test, these ares will be flat
        (featureless), and provide good samples of average pixel intensity.
    </p>

            <br/>
            <i>Green squares above and below the search area (outlined in yellow) indicate the pixels used to determine
                the average brightness of each column of pixels.</i>
        </center>
    </div>

    <p>
        The mean value of each column of pixels in the green areas (both above and below the search area) is calculated.
        Next, the mean value of the dimmest column is selected. For each of the columns in the search area (in yellow),
        the value of each pixel is multiplied by:
    </p>

    <div style="text-indent: 50px;">
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $CompensationFactor = ColumnMeanValue / DimmestColumnMeanValue$
        </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        The result is to reduce the differences in columnar amplification.

    </div>


    <p>
        Testing of this image processing waas performed on over 200 images from seven different treatment machines.
        Changes in pixel location were small and random, except in situations such as the one above, where there a
        significant bias in the image. In those cases the BB's position would change by approximately 0.5 mm.
    </p>


    <hr style='margin:40px;'/>
    <h3>Coarse (approximate) Location of BB</h3>
    <p> The square is searched by constructing a template of pixels approximating the BB using its radius
        (configuration parameter <b>EPIDBBPenumbra_mm</b>). That template is checked at every position within the search
        area to determine which position yields the brightest set of pixels. That position is used as the coarse
        position of the BB. </p>

                the resolutions used for Daily QA OBI.</i>
        </center>
    </div>

    <hr style='margin:40px;'/>
    <h3>Precise Location</h3>
    <p>
        To determine the BB's precise location, the center pixel of the coarse location is used as a starting point.
        Next, the brightest of all adjacent pixels (sharing an edge or corner) is selected and added to the BB. Again,
        the brightest pixel adjacent to the two BBs is found and added. This process is iterated, growing the BB until
        enough pixels have been found such that the sum of their area is the same as the area of the BB.
    </p>


    <div style="margin:30px;">
        <center>
            <a href='CloseupAnimated.gif'
               title='The image below shows a close up image with pixel values contrasted for clarity. The pixels of the BB are identified and marked as green.'>
                <img width='512' src='CloseupAnimated.gif'/>
            </a>
            <br/>
            <i>An animated close up image with pixel values contrasted for clarity. The pixels of the BB are identified
                and marked as green. The progression of images shows how the algorithm starts with the brightest pixel
                from the coarse location, and then incrementally adds the brightest adjacent pixels. It stops when the
                number of pixels is equivalent to the area of the BB. Using the center of mass gives bright pixels more
                influence than dim ones.</i>
        </center>
    </div>

    <p> Note that this will usually yield more pixels than the template because it does not have the restriction of
        having to maintain geometric symmetry. One problem this approach addresses is that the BB has no clear edges, so
        instead it bases 'what is part of the BB" on the BB's size. The adjacency requirement also avoids selecting
        random single bright pixels that may be in the search area. </p>

    <p> Finally the center of mass (which includes the pixels' location and brightness) of the BB's pixels is calculated
        in X and Y to determine the BB's precise location. </p>

    <hr style='margin:40px;'/>
    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <p>Given the small number of pixels composing the BB, and the image's noisiness, it is possible that image noise in
        the form of a few bright pixels could look like a BB and fool the algorithm. </p>

    <p> To guard against this, the BB must be significantly brighter than the surrounding pixels. To determine this, the
        standard deviation and mean of the pixels in the search area that are not included by the BB is calculated. A BB
        standard deviation multiple is calculated by:</p>

    <div style="text-indent: 50px;">
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $SearchArea_{mean}$ : Mean value of pixels inside the search area but not part of the BB.
        </p>
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $BB_{mean}$ : Mean value of BB's pixels (shown in green)
        </p>
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $SearchArea_{StandardDeviation}$ : Standard deviation of pixels in search area but not part of BB
        </p>
        <p style="margin:30px;">
            $$RelativeBBBrightness = absoluteValueOf(BB_{mean} - SearchArea_{mean}) / SearchArea_{StandardDeviation} $$
        </p>
    </div>

    <p style='margin-left:80px; margin-right:80px;'>
        <i>Note: For pixels to qualify as background, they must be far enough away from the precise center of the BB.
            The distance used is three times the BB's radius (Configuration parameter: <b>EPIDBBPenumbra_mm</b>.)</i>
    </p>

    <p style='margin-top:50px;'>
        If $RelativeBBBrightness$ is larger than the configuration parameter
        <b><i>EPIDBBMinimumStandardDeviation</i></b>, then the BB is considered valid. The value of this configuration
        parameter was chosen by observing the value from a variety of EPID images.

    <h3>Final Notes</h3>
    <p>
        While this test is sufficient to validate Daily QA OBI, it should be noted that because the BB is small, it's
        location is based on a very few pixels. Also, because that EPID images are taken at a low energy, the images
        tend to be noisier. The implication is that there are limits to how accurately the BB may be located.
