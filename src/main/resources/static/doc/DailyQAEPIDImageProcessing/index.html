        This describes the BB finding algorithm and precise measurement of the BB's location.
    </p>

    <h3>Coarse (approximate) Location of BB</h3>
    <p>
        The first step is to determine the BB's approximate location within the EPID plane. This is done by restricting
        the search area to a square centered in the image. The size of the square is 2 x BBbyEPIDSearchDistance_mm,
        where BBbyEPIDSearchDistance_mm is a configuration value. The size of the square is smaller than the cube
        containing the BB. The square is searched by examining each possible array of 2x2 pixels to see which is the
        brightest. Next, the brightest adjacent pixels are included until an area has been acquired that is equivalent
        to the area of the BB.
    </p>

    <p>
        The center of mass (which includes the pixels' location and brightness) of the BB's
        pixels is calculated in X and Y to determine the BB's precise location.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the BB's location to be valid, it must be significantly brighter than the surrounding pixels. For
        validation, the standard deviation and mean of the pixels in the search area that are not included by the BB is
        calculated. A BB standard deviation multiple is calculated by:

    <p>
        $$absoluteValueOf(BB_{mean} - SearchArea_{mean}) / SearchArea_{StandardDeviation} $$
    </p>

    If this value is large enough, then the BB is considered valid. The configuration value
    EPIDBBMinimumStandardDeviation is used for the comparison.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that EPID image quality can be reduced by using an open field instead of restricting the treated field
        to the size in the RTPLAN.
