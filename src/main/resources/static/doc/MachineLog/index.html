    <p>
        The Machine Log procedure allows users to upload machine logs in XML format and automatically create maintenance
        records. The records are formatted for better readability and show up in history charts including Phase 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        To run, go to <a href="/run/WebRunIndex">Run Procedures</a> and click <b>Machine Log</b>. Upload the the XML
        files from your <b>I</b> drive using drag and drop and then click the <b>Run</b> button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below is an example of a machine log file:
    </p>

    <div style="margin:10px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img src="XmlAnnotated.png" style="margin:30px;" width="800px;"/>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
        Processing the above machine log will produce the following output. The <b>New</b> designation indicates
        maintenance records that were created by this run. If the same machine log was uploaded a second time it would
        not be marked as new. The point is to prevent the user from accidentally making duplicate maintenance records.
        Note that multiple machine logs may be uploaded in a single run.
    </p>

    <div style="margin:10px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img src="reportCollapsed.png" style="margin:30px;" width="800px;"/>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
        Using the magnifying glass icons to expand the content and then each item, it will appear as below. The
        originating machine log is shown for verification.
    </p>


    <div style="margin:10px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img src="report.png" style="margin:10px;" width="1200px;"/>
    </div>

    <p>Automatically created maintenance records can clutter charts. Clicking on records in the chart will hide them.
        When a record is clicked, it and all other records with the same category and summary will be hidden.</p>

    <p>Below is an example of a chart before and after with several of the maintenance records hidden. Reloading the
        page will make them visible.</p>

    <div style="margin:10px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img src="hide.png" style="margin:10px;"/>
    </div>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>Node</b> in the log is used to designate the maintenance record's category. There are nine node
            names:
        </li>

        <b>
            <style>td { padding: 20px; background: #dddddd; border: 1px solid #555555;}</style>
            <table style="margin-left:100px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">
                <tr>
                    <td>Beam Generation Module</td>
                    <td>Collimator</td>
                    <td>Couch</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Kilo Voltage Detector</td>
                    <td>Kilo Voltage Source</td>
                    <td>Mega Voltage Detector</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Stand</td>
                    <td>Supervisor</td>
                    <td>XRay Imager</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </b>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">Hierarchically organized group names are concatenated from the top to the bottom of
            the hierarchy to create
            the record's summary. A maintenance record is created for each hierarchy path, even if two multi-part paths
            only differ by one group name.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;">A machine log can create zero or more maintenance records. Some machine logs do not
            contain any nodes while
            others contain multiple nodes.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">If the same machine log is uploaded more than once, only one set of maintenance
            records are created. This
            protects against unintentional duplicate uploads, which may occur when periodically updating log files.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;">If a machine log output is deleted from the <b>Results</b> page, then the
            maintenance records and machine
            logs that it created (new) will also be deleted. This provides the user with the equivalent of an undo
            operation.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">Maintenance records generated from machine logs can not be edited.</li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">Maintenance records generated from machine logs can be deleted. Performing a <b>Redo</b>
            of the output will re-create the deleted records.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">Files may be uploaded as a zip archive, which may improve upload time.</li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">Files may be uploaded by dragging and dropping their parent folder.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-bottom:100px;"></p>
