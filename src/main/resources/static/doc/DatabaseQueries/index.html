    <p>
        The AQA software uses an SQL database. This user guide provides sample queries to simplify users' experience. If
        you need a query that is not listed, please contact the site administrator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples include the <b>LIMIT 10</b> statement which limits the number of rows returned to 10 to make it more
        appropriate while becoming familiar with the data. Remove or change this to get more data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The AQA software is compatible with both PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL server databases. The Automated Quality
        Assurance site uses PostreSQL version 12.5 R5.

        The <b>isBaseline_text</b> column is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. If <b>true</b>, it means that this data
        set should be used as a baseline for those that follow it chronologically for the same beam and machine until
        the
        next baseline or the last data set.
