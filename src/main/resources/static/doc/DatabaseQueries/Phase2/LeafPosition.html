        Currently there are are <em style="color: white; background-color: red;">&#xA0;over 2 million rows </em> in this
        table, so the quantity of data in a single query should be restricted by adding <b>WHERE</b> clauses. The
        following query limits by <b>leafIndex</b>, <b>leafPositionIndex</b>, and <b>machine</b>.
