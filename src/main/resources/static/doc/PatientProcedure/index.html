    <p>
        The <a href="/admin/PatientProcedureList">Patient Procedure</a> list associates patient IDs with the test
        procedures that are run on them.  This supports the AQA Client service that supports automatic uploading
        of data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The AQA Client service must be installed on your local system for data to be automatically uploaded.
        At this time it is still experimental and not available for general use.
    </p>

    <p>
        Periodically, the planning system is scanned for new data for each of the patient IDs.
        When one is found, it looks at this list to see which procedure is to be run on it and runs
        the analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        When transitioning to a new set of patient IDs, the new ones may be added to the list before
        they come into clinical use. Said another way, the old and new patient IDs may be listed at
        the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        When no longer in use, entries may be deprecated by deleting them from the list. Unchecking
        the <b>Active</b> flag has the same effect, though having a long list produces clutter and
        is harder to maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a good convention to assign a patient ID to a single machine because it simplifies
        viewing in the planning system. The AQA system does not impose this restriction. If a
        patient that was originally intended to be associated for one machine but is scanned on
        another machine, then the results will be linked to the machine, not the patient.
