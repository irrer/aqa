    <ul>
        <li style="margin-top:40px;">
            Fill in the <b>Patient ID</b> (MRN). <em> Do not use the patient name.</em>
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">
            Select the procedure to be performed on that patient.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">
            Make sure the <b>Active</b> flag is checked. To indicate that a patient ID is no longer in active use,
            uncheck
            this flag.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;">
            Click the <b>Save</b> button which will return you to the list.

    <p>
        This is used by the AQA Client service that supports automatic uploading of data. The AQA Client service must be
        installed on your local system for data to be automatically uploaded. At this time it is still experimental and
        not available for general use.
    </p>

    <p>
        Periodically, the AQA Client scans the planning system for new data for each of the patient IDs. When new data
        is found, it looks at this list to see how it is to be processed, and sends the data to the AQA server.
    </p>

    <p>
        When transitioning to a new set of patient IDs, the new ones may be added to the list before
        they come into clinical use. Said another way, the old and new patient IDs may be listed at
        the same time and the client will search both for new data.
    </p>

    <p>
        When no longer in use, entries may be deprecated by deleting them from the list. Unchecking
        the <b>Active</b> flag has the same effect, though having a long list produces clutter and
        is harder to maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
        As patient IDs fall out of use, they should be removed from the list or marked as not active to reduce resource
        use.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a good convention to assign a patient ID to a single machine because it simplifies
        viewing in the planning system. The AQA system does not impose this restriction. If a
        patient that was originally intended to be associated for one machine but is scanned on
        another machine, then the results will be linked to the machine, not the patient.
