Projection

While all test results are reported in the isoplane in mm,
measurements are performed in the image plane.

Positions are calculated by using pixels' dimension and
center position in the image plane and using the SID and SAD
of the RTIMAGE.  Note that the SID and SAD might vary
between images within a series.  The variation is generally
very small, but is taken into account.  Also, image pixel
coordinates are start at 0,0 for the upper left hand side of
the image, while isoplane coordinates 0,0 are at the center
of the image.

The following example shows the conversion of an edge
position found in image plane converted to the corresponding
position in the isoplane.
