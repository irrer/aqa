        The goal is to determine how closely a bb in a phantom is aligned with the plan isocenter.
    </p>

    <h3>Processing</h3>
    <p>
        The first step is to determine the bb's location within the CBCT volume. A 3D volume is constructed, and a VOI (volume of interest is
        searched for the bb. The reasons for limiting the search
        volume are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The bb must be within a bounded volume or the test will fail.</li>
        <li>Avoiding objects elsewhere in the image that would make recognizing the bb difficult if not impossible.</li>
        <li>Computational efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        All possible sub-volumes of the VOI are searched of size 4*4*2 (X*Y*Z) voxels. The sub-volume with the largest sum of voxel values
        is assumed to be a coarse location for the bb.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, a sub-volume is taken that is slightly larger than the actual size of the bb (the size of the bb is a configuration value) centered
        on the coarse location. The sub-volume is summed across
        the 3 different axis to create 3 one-dimensional arrays. The profile of each
        array is analyzed with a center of mass algorithm to determine the exact center of the bb in each dimension. As a
        further check, the magnitude
        of the 'bump' in each profile created by the bb is checked to ensure that it is above a given number (configured value) of standard deviations
        to reject random image
        noise.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <div>
        Given the bb's location in pixels $pix_X, pix_Y, pix_Z$, the location is converted to the frame of reference $for_X, for_Y, for_Z$ in mm by multiplying the X and Y coordinates
        by
        the
        <b>PixelSpacing</b>
        for X and Y,
        and the Z coordinate by the
        <b>SliceThickness</b>
        . The result is offset by the
        <b>ImagePositionPatient</b>
        from the slice with the lowest Z coordinate value:

        $$for_X = pix_X \times PixelSpacing_X + ImagePositionPatient_X$$
        $$for_Y = pix_Y \times PixelSpacing_Y + ImagePositionPatient_Y$$
        $$for_Z =
        pix_Z \times SliceThickness + ImagePositionPatient_Z$$
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>0028,0030 PixelSpacing</b>
                : Physical distance in the patient between the center of each pixel, specified by a numeric pair - adjacent row spacing (delimiter) adjacent column spacing in mm
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>0018,0050 SliceThickness</b>
                : Nominal slice thickness, in mm.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>0020,0032 ImagePositionPatient</b>
                : The x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner (center of the first voxel transmitted) of the image, in mm.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p></p>


    <p>
        The coordinates in mm are then translated to the RTPLAN frame of reference. To do this, a DICOM REG file is
        found (note the DICOM uses a UID, aka unique id, to identify frames of reference)
        that
        references both the
        CBCT's frame of reference and the RTPLAN's frame of reference as shown in the diagram below.
    </p>

        <img src="CBCT_REG_RTPLAN.png" style="margin:30px;" />
    </div>



    <p>
        Standard linear algebra is used to multiply
        the vector by the $4\times4$ matrix contained in the DICOM REG file as
        <b>FrameOfReferenceTransformationMatrix</b>
        . The resulting vector is the bb's
        $X,Y,Z$ location in the RTPLAN's frame of reference. The RTPLAN
        <b>IsocenterPosition</b>
        is subtracted from the result to get the error between CBCT and isocenter:

        $$X_{error} = X_{CBCT} - X_{PLAN}$$
        $$Y_{error} = Y_{CBCT} - Y_{PLAN}$$
        $$Z_{error} = Z_{CBCT} - Z_{PLAN}$$
    </p>

    <div>
        DICOM attributes used to map the CBCT's frame of reference to the RTPLAN's frame of reference:

                Frame of Reference or atlas. This sequence contains the CBCT

        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
        There is a special case where the CBCT has the same frame of reference as the RTPLAN, and no matrix transformation
        is necessary. While the analysis will be performed, the results may or may not
        be useful. In practice this should not occur, but the software does support it.

    <h4>Calculations</h4>
    <p></p>
    Determine coordinates of bb in CBCT frame of reference in mm:
    $$ X = 275.863 \times 0.51119 + -130.2839 = 10.7349192 $$
    $$ Y = 238.8094845 \times 0.51119 + -130.70374936618 = -8.6265526 $$
    $$ Z =
    48.478
    \times 1.98972453680719 + -91.855446207549 = 4.6017616 $$

    <br />
    <p></p>

    Transform with matrix to RTPLAN coordinates:

    $$
    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    10.7349192\\
    -8.6265526\\
    4.6017616\\
    0

    -6.006019\\

    1.0& 0.000000& 0.000000& 1.000000
    \end{array}
    \right]

    =

    \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
    4.745294\\
    162.582208\\
    64.492228\\
    1.0
    \end{array}
    \right]
    $$

    Subtract the RTPLAN isocenter from the CBCT coordinates to determine the error:

    $$
    X_{error} = 4.745294 - 4.221317 = 0.52398
    $$
    $$
    Y_{error} = 162.582208 - 162.6656 = 0.083384
    $$
    $$
    Z_{error} =
    64.492228 - 64.92423 = -0.43202
