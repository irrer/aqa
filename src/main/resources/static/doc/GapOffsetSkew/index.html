    <p>
        The Gap Offset and Skew test procedure measures the alignment of collimator leaves to determine how accurately
        they are
        being positioned.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="/GapSkewLatestHtml">Latest Gap Skew</a> results show a summary of activity as shown below:

    <h3>Technical Background</h3>

    <p>
        Edge measurements are acquired by selecting segments of the edge on the left and right ends. The segments are
        chosen
        to begin and end in the middle of a leaf, and span two leaves. They are positioned to be far enough away from
        the
        edge of the image and vertical jaws to avoid their effects.
    </p>

    <p>
        The image below shows the detail of a measurement. The black horizontal line shows the length of the segment.
        The vertical gray lines (added for clarity) show the sides of the collimator leaves.
    </p>

            <img src="MeasurementDetail.png" width="300" style="margin:5px; border: 1px solid lightgray;"/>
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The angle of an edge is calculated with:
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 20px;">
        $ angle = atan((Y_{Right} - Y_{Left}) / (X_{Right} - X_{Left})) $
    </p>
    <p>
        Where $X_{Right}$ and $X_{Left}$ are the horizontal centers of the right and left segments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Angles are expressed both in degrees and mm/40 cm.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary Page</h3>

    <p>
        The <a href="/GapSkewLatestHtml" target="_blank">Gap, Offset and Skew</a> page lists all results for all
        machines and allows the user to navigate to specific results. The screen capture below provides and example.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Clicking on dates shows further details.</li>
        <li> Results with white background are recent, and those with gray background are older.</li>
        <li> There is one row of results for each treatment machine.</li>
        <li> Results are ordered chronologically, with the most recently delivered data sets on the left.</li>
        <li> Those results labeled "Missing Data" correspond to incomplete data sets. Results for individual images are
            reported, but the composite results are not.
        </li>
        <li> This page does not update automatically. Use you browser's refresh button to get the latest results.</li>

    <h3>Composite Test Results</h3>

    <p>
        The following shows a report for one set of beams. Major sections describe:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Meta-information, including the machine and when the data was capture and when it was analyzed.</li>
        <li> Table of composite results. Hovering the mouse over individual number will show (example for 0.182):
            As shown below, hovering over individual values will show (example for 0.182):

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <ul> As shown on the right, hovering over individual values will show (example for 0.182):
                            <li> The name of the value.</li>
                            <li> How the value was derived from other values.</li>
                            <li> The precise value and the math used to calculate it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>

        <li>Historical graphs for composite results for this machine. These are dynamically updated as more (future)
            results are captured. The points for this data set are orange.
        </li>
        <li> Images for individual beams and their individual measurements. Clicking on the beam name will show more
            beam details.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Individual Beam Report</h3>
    <p>
        Clicking on the beam names in composite test results page will take you to a page like the screenshot below that
        shows detailed results for a single beam.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking on the image will show a larger image and list the complete DICOM meta-data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The report shows values from this beam only, and includes graphs over time of selected values. At the bottom of
        the page are selected DICOM meta-values providing relevant information.
