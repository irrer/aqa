    <p>
        The flood field is used by AQA to create a PSM (Pixel Sensitivity Matrix). Treatment machines create a new flood
        field when an EPID recalibration is performed. This procedure allows users to upload their latest flood field to
        AQA.  This is often done as a prelude to uploading a PSM.
    </p>
    <p>
        A flood field may also be uploaded with the PSM files.
    </p>
    <p>
        The flood field consists of a single DICOM image with modality RTIMAGE. However, while RTIMAGE files generally
        contain a DICOM <a

        Serial Number (0018,1000)</a> the flood field does not. Because of this you must specify which machine the file
        comes from.
