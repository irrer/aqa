    <p>
        The Gap and Skew procedure measures the alignment of collimator leaves to determine how accurately they are
        being positioned.

            <b>Position (mm) : </b>Describes the edge for which values are being given, indicating whether it is formed
            by the jaw or MLC.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Skew (deg) : </b>The angle of rotation for the edge. If the absolute value is too large, then the test
            will fail. A perfect test would yield a value of zero.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Delta (mm) : </b>The rise or fall in mm from left to right of the edge. A perfect test would yield a
            value of zero. It is <br/>calculated by subtracting the left vertical measurement from
            the right: $Y_{Right} - Y_{Left}$.

    <h3>Technical Details</h3>

    <p>
        Edge measurements are acquired by selecting segments of the edge on the left and right ends. The segments are
        chosen
        to begin and end in the middle of a leaf, and span two leaves. They are positioned to be far enough away from
        the
        edge of the image and vertical jaws to avoid their effects.
    </p>

    <p>
        The image below shows the detail of a measurement. The black horizontal line shows the length of the segment.
        The vertical gray lines (added for clarity) show the sides of the collimator leaves.
    </p>

        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The angle of an edge is calculated with:
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 20px;">
        $ angle = atan((Y_{Right} - Y_{Left}) / (X_{Right} - X_{Left})) $
    </p>
    Where $X_{Right}$ and $X_{Left}$ are the horizontal centers of the right and left segments.
    </p>
