<div title="Creating a Custom Plan">
    <h2 >@@title@@<p> </p> <br/></h2>
    <p>To run the Phase 2 tests, you must submit a set of EPID images created by a compatible RTPLAN.</p>

    <p>Often simply copying an RTPLAN from another institution does not work because of incompatibilities
        with machine
        name, beam energies, and tolerance table names. The Customize Plan feature
        addresses this.
    </p>

    <p> </p>
        The steps are:

        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to Administration --> Machines</li>

            <li>Select the machine from the list that you wish to make the plan for. If it does not exist, use Create
                new
                Machine
                to create
                it.
            </li>

            <li>Make sure that the list of beam energies that your machine supports is correct.</li>

            <li>Click the Customize Plan button</li>
        </ul>
    <p> </p>


    <p>The following screen shot shows an example for a machine named Foo.</p>

    <div style="margin:30px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img src="CustomizePlanUI.png" style="margin:30px;" />
    </div>

    <p>Fill in the fields:</p>

    <div style="margin:30px;">
        <p>
            <b>Patient ID:</b>
            This will be filled with a default value but you may override it with something that
            will make it convenient
            for
            you to track in your system.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Patient Name:</b>
            Similar to Patient ID
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Tolerance Table Name:</b>
            Initially empty, this must be filled with a tolerance table that your treatment planning system supports.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Plan Name:</b>
            Set by default, this can be overridden, often reflecting a version of the plan.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Machine Name:</b>
            The name that your planning system expects. Some planning systems have different values for machine ID and
            machine name.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Click one of the the Create buttons and a preview will be shown (Phase 2 is shown here):</p>

    <div style="margin:30px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img src="CustomizePlanDownload.png" style="margin:30px;" />
    </div>

    <p>Click Download to download a DICOM version of the RTPLAN.</p>

    <p>The RTPLAN may then be imported into your planning system.</p>

    <p>Note: The AQA keeps track of custom made plans, so it is not necessary to upload them later.</p>

    <h4>Technical Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom plans are created by taking a master plan and modifying it. The collimator and beam energies in
            machine configuration parameters are used, so it is important that they be correct.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is a master plan for each of the Millenium and HD MLC collimators. The choice of which to start from
            is
            determined by the
            <b>Collimator</b>
            choice in machine configuration.
        </li>

        <li>All treatment machines are expected to support 6 MeV, and that is the energy that most beams in Phase 2 use.
            Beyond that, machines may be set up to handle different energies. The master plans have a J18G0-6F beam
            which is copied for the other beam energies that a machine may support. For example, if a machine support 16
            Mev, then a J18G0-16F beam will be added to the custom plan.
        </li>

        <li>The order of the beams in the plan was chosen to optimize delivery time by minimizing mechanical movement.
            When a plan is created, each beam name is prefixed with a number that, when sorted, will preserve this
            order.
        </li>

        <li>When a plan is created, it uses all new UIDs. This is so it will be entirely separate from other versions of
            the plan and can be imported into a treatment planning system without conflicts.
        </li>

        <li>The instance creation date and time of the plan are automatically set to the current time to help keep track
            of plans.
        </li>
    </ul>
