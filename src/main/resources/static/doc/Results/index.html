    <p>
        The Results page provides a list of all test results. This is the primary mechanism for accessing reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, data is sorted by processing date, but clicking on the column headers will sort by that column.
    </p>

    <div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

    <h3>Field Definitions</h3>

    <ul>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Refresh: </b>Clicking this will refresh the page with the latest results.</li>

        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>All Institutions: </b>Checking this, followed by clicking <b>Refresh</b>, will
            show results from all institutions. Data from other institutions will be displayed anonymously.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Analysis: </b>When the analysis was performed.</li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Acquisition: </b>When the data was acquired at the machine.</li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Redo: </b>Clicking this link will redo the analysis. This can be useful in cases
            where there was a problem during analysis (such as the server shutting down), or when the analysis software
            has changed.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Procedure: </b>The name of the test.</li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Machine: </b>The machine from which the data originated.</li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Institution: </b>The Institution from which the data originated.</li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>User: </b>The user that uploaded the data. This may be different from the user
            that delivered the test at the machine.
        </li>
        <li style="margin-top:20px;"><b>Delete/State: </b>This selector shows the validity state of the data, and also
            allows the user to change the state or delete the data.
            <p>By default, data is marked as valid. In some cases, data is later found to be invalid, due to errors in
                delivery or other causes. Invalid data can visually skew charts and subsequent analysis. Marking a
                result as invalid means that its data will not show up in historical (data over time) charts elsewhere
                in AQA, and it will not be included in <!--suppress HtmlUnknownTarget --> <a href="/Phase2CsvRestlet">CSV
                    downloads</a>.</p>

            <p>After marking a result as valid or invalid, the change will be reflected immediately in history charts
                upon the next web page refresh. For <!--suppress HtmlUnknownTarget --> <a href="/Phase2CsvRestlet">CSV
                    downloads</a>, the change will not be reflected until after the CSV files are regenerated.</p>

            <p>Marking results as valid or invalid can be un-done by changing the status again.</p>

            <p>The user also has the option of deleting data. Clicking <b>delete</b> will first ask for a confirmation.
                If confirmed, the data will be removed from the system. This operation can not be un-done, however the
                uer may re-upload the data at a future date.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
