    This test determines the position error of each collimator leaf at a variety of positions. For each leaf position,
    the expected (from RTPLAN) position is subtracted from the observed position and the error reported in mm in the
    isoplane:

    <h4 style="margin: 40px;">
        <code>error = observed - expected</code>
    </h4>
    
    <p>The following example shows the measured positions of the leaf ends and sides (as dashed lines) as well as the
    expected (planned) positions, compensated with the results from the collimator centering, shown as solid lines.</p>

    <h3>Leaf Sides</h3>
    <p>
        A better measurement of the leaf ends can be made if the position of the leaf sides is known. The image below
        shows
        that leaf ends are close together, so there is a risk that the position of a leaf end may be influenced by
        its
        neighbors:

    <p>To measure the leaf sides, the sum of each row (or columns if the collimator were turned 90 degrees) of pixels in
        the entire image is taken, which yields a profile. The following graph shows an example taken from a Millenium
        collimator:
