    <p>This test determines the position error of each collimator leaf at a variety of positions. For each leaf
        position, the expected (from RTPLAN with collimator center position added) position is subtracted from the
        measured position and the error reported in mm in the isoplane:
    </p>

    <h4 style="margin: 40px;">
        <pre>error = measured - expected</pre>
    </h4>

    <h3>Image Processing: Leaf Sides</h3>
    <p>The first step in the analysis is to measure the positions of the leaf sides. Accurate measurements are necessary
        to isolate the positions of a leaf end from the adjacent leaves.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px;">
    </p>
    <p>The following example from a Millenium collimator shows the measured positions of the leaf ends and sides (as
        dashed lines) as well as the
        expected (planned) positions, compensated with the results from the collimator
        centering, shown as solid lines.

    <p style="margin: 30px;">
    </p>
    <p>To measure the leaf sides, the sum of each row (or columns if the collimator were turned 90 degrees) of pixels in
        the entire image is taken, which yields a profile. The following graph shows an example taken from a Millenium
        collimator showing a peak for each leaf side (click for full size image):
    </p>

        title="Example of Millenium leaf side profile.  Click for full sized image.">
        <img src="LeafSideProfileMillenium.png" width="800px" />
    </a>

    <p>Using the expected widths of the leaves, the profile is traversed to obtain a rough estimate of the
        difference in
        height between the peaks and valleys. A qualitative measurement is
        made for each peak. A well
        defined peak is one
        that shows an adjacent valley at the expected distance on either side.
    </p>

    <p>While the above profile shows well-defined peaks and valleys, images from HD MLC collimators can be less so.
        Below is an example of the image from an HD MLC collimator followed by a leaf-side profile for an HD MLC
        collimator:

    </a>

    <p style="margin: 30px;">
    </p>

    <p>Because the positions of some leaf sides can be difficult to discriminate, only the best (in terms of peak-valley
        rise and fall) defined leaf sides are used. The assumption is made that at least two leaf sides will be well
        defined.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px;">
    </p>
    <p>Given the best defined leaf sides, a cubic spline is mathematically calculated over the peaks using the profile.
        The resulting cubic spline function is searched for the highest point, which is the exact position
        of the peak.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 10px;">
    </p>
    <p>The exact peak positions are matched with their nearest expected leaf sides to determine which leaves they are
        identifying.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 10px;">
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the collimator is a rigid body with known dimensions, the remaining leaf sides are linearly extrapolated
        by using their nearest precisely located neighbors. These values, added to
        <a href="/static/doc/CollimatorCentering/index.html">collimator centering,</a>
        yield the measured position of the leaf sides. These are displayed as the solid horizontal lines in the images
        above.
    </p>

    <h3>Image Processing: Leaf Ends</h3>
    <p style="margin: 10px;">
    </p>

    <p>
        Each leaf end is measured by first placing a bounding box (shown in white) around the expected position as shown
        in the image below.
    </p>
    <center>
        <p>

                0.1247 mm error is the difference of measured - expected.
            </b>
        </p>
        <img src="LeafPositionEnlarged.png" />
    </center>

    <p style="margin: 20px;">
    </p>
    <p>The box is centered horizontally around the expected leaf position (vertical dashed line) The vertical top and
        bottom of the box are 0.5 mm (a configurable value) from the measured leaf sides (horizontal solid lines). The
        0.5 mm space isolates the measurement of this leaf end from the vertically adjacent leaf ends. Note that the
        vertical solid lines (the measured leaf ends) also show this 0.5 mm gap.
    </p>

    <p>The average pixel value is found For each row of pixels in the box. All pixels that are above the average are
        processed to find their horizontal center of mass:
    </p>

    <pre>center of mass = (sum of value * position) / (number of pixels)</pre>


    <p>
        The center of masses of each pixel row are averaged to find the center of the leaf end. This value is then
        added
        to the
        <a href="/static/doc/CollimatorCentering/index.html">collimator centering</a>
        value, yielding the final result.
    </p>

    <p>Some justifications for the algorithm:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Each row of pixels is evaluated separately (as opposed to performing a center of mass on the entire area) so
            that the pixels in the middle of the edge (centered vertically) will have the same influence as those near
            the sides. In fact, an argument can be made that because the pixels in the (vertical) center of the edge are
            influenced the least by the sides and adjacent ends and so will most accurately reflect the true end of the
            leaf.
        </li>
        <p style="margin: 10px;">
        </p>
        <li>Only above-average pixels are used to diminish the weight of the background should the bounding
            box be placed
            in a highly horizontally skewed position.
        </li>
        <p style="margin: 10px;">
        </p>
        <li>Center of mass (as opposed to fitting a cubic spline) is used because edge profiles are often not smoothly
            defined peaks, and can be very irregular.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that the edges of the bounding box will usually not be at pixel boundaries. To accommodate this, pixels that
        are only partially included in the box are weighted accordingly. For example, if a row of pixels is 40% inside
        the box, then the row would be given a 40% weight.
    </p>
