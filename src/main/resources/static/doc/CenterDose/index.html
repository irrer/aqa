    <p>This test measures the dose in CU in the center of the image. The measurement is obtained by
        defining a 5 mm (configurable as CenterDoseRadius_mm) radius circle in the isoplane and calculating
        the average CU of the pixels within that circle, as shown below:

    <p>
        The center of the circle is defined with the coordinates obtained by
        <a href='../CollimatorCentering/index.html'>Collimator Centering</a>
        . Because a circle is being mapped onto a rectangular grid of pixels,
        sub-pixel variations in collimator centering can change which pixels
        are considered within the circle.
    </p>

    <p>A pixel is considered to be inside the circle if the center of the pixel
        is equal to or less than the configured radius.
    </p>
